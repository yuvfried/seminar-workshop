# Notebooks

1. **The_IB_Method.ipynb**:
An introduction to the Information Bottlneck method.
2. **Apply_IB_to_Theoretic_XY.ipynb**:
Copmuting Surprise predictor of IB model to a given joint distribution of X and Y.
3. **simulate_surprise_signal.ipynb**:
Simulate a block from experiment and compute its corresponding surprise signal.
4. **IB_Model_Compression.ipynb**:
Shows the Compression of a model (I(Xhat;X)) as a function of different N and Beta.
5. **Noise_Analysis.ipynb**:
A Method that quantifies the quality of model fitting to a given subject. This is done by simulating EEG from theoretical surprise at different noise levels.
6. **Halflife_vs_N.ipynb**:
Comparing the N of IB model to the halflife of Exponential Moving Average of Ridge regression.
7. **beta_vs_lambda.ipynb**:
Comparing the beta of IB model to the lambda regularization of a fitted Ridge regression.
8. **apply_decay_model_real_data.ipynb**
Apply decay model to subjects data.
